    "review": "{\n    \"Summary\": \"The authors compare methods to emphasize words in neural TTS that use a phoneme duration predictor. They compare a system trained with data with explicit emphasis (where the speaker is instructed to emphasize certain words) with a system trained on data with no explicit labelling of emphasis, for which the durations of the word with emphasis are just multiplied by a certain factor. They demonstrate that the covariations between prosodic dimensions learned by the acoustic decoder significantly improve perceived naturalness over spectrogram modification techniques.\",\n    \"Strengths\": [\n        \" Control of emphasis that does not require explicit recordings nor labelling\"\n    ],\n    \"Weaknesses\": [\n        \"Evaluation methodology is weak, since subjects are asked to rate utterances with emphasis. Acoustic analysis of only one case is not sufficient to demonstrate the "naturalness" of the control policy!\",\n  \"This research is data-frugal.\"\n  ],\n    \"Originality\": 2,\n    \"Quality\": 3\n    \"Clarity\": 2,\n    \"Significance\": 3,\n    \"Questions\": [\n        \"How test words with emphasis are chosen? some words with strong semantic weight are often emphasized by default (negations, superlatives, etc). What happens with these words?\",\n 	\"The low anchor should be TTS without any emphasis control. The evaluation is biased by attention: the target word is explicitly given as instruction\",\n	\"How to interpret reference tests : do they test the acoustic degradation or the adequacy of the control policy?\",\n	\"Provide more stats on acoustic signatures: a case example is not a proof of concept. \",\n	\"Please refer to word-internal "pauses" as hiatus!!!\",\n	\"For FLAG-EMPH, did you compare emphatic markers surrounding words under emphasis as an alternative to flag concatenation? Seems that one flag does not compete so well with the large dimension of phoneme embeddings...\"\n    ],\n    \"Limitations\": [\n        \"My major concern is about the clarity of the paper and some additional ablation models (see cons below). Hopefully the authors can address my concern in the rebuttal period.\"\n    ],\n    \"Ethical Concerns\": false,\n    \"Soundness\": 3,\n    \"Presentation\": 2,\n    \"Contribution\": 3,\n    \"Overall\": 6,\n    \"Confidence\": 5,\n    \"Decision\": \"Accept\"\n}"
