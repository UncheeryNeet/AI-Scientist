# Title: Implement parameterised analytic filterbanks and preemphasis modules, which is a extension of SincConv, to RawNet2
# Experiment description: Parameterised Analytic Filterbank is used to process raw waveform into time-frequency representation. Successfully implementing the module could potentially lead to broader search dimension of models in anti-spoofing domain. It can be enabled by configuring preemp option in RawNet2 module

## Plots Description

### Training Loss Across Runs
- **Filename**: `train_loss_ASVspoof2019_across_runs.png`
- **Description**: This plot shows the training loss across different runs (run_0 to run_5). Each run corresponds to a different configuration of the preemphasis module. The x-axis represents the iteration number, and the y-axis represents the training loss. The plot helps in understanding how the training loss evolves over time for each run.

### Validation Loss Across Runs
- **Filename**: `val_loss_ASVspoof2019_across_runs.png`
- **Description**: This plot shows the validation loss across different runs (run_0 to run_5). The x-axis represents the epoch number, and the y-axis represents the validation loss. The plot helps in understanding how the validation loss evolves over epochs for each run.

### Validation EER Across Runs
- **Filename**: `val_eer_ASVspoof2019_across_runs.png`
- **Description**: This plot shows the validation EER (Equal Error Rate) across different runs (run_0 to run_5). The x-axis represents the epoch number, and the y-axis represents the validation EER. The plot helps in understanding how the validation EER evolves over epochs for each run.

### Test Accuracy Across Runs
- **Filename**: `test_accuracy_ASVspoof2019_across_runs.png`
- **Description**: This plot shows the test accuracy across different runs (run_0 to run_5). The x-axis represents the run name, and the y-axis represents the test accuracy in percentage. The plot helps in comparing the test accuracy of each run.

### Test EER Across Runs
- **Filename**: `test_eer_ASVspoof2019_across_runs.png`
- **Description**: This plot shows the test EER (Equal Error Rate) across different runs (run_0 to run_5). The x-axis represents the run name, and the y-axis represents the test EER in percentage. The plot helps in comparing the test EER of each run.
