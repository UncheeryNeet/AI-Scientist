Implement a new class for depthwise separable convolutions and integrate it into the existing residual block structure. Train the modified model on the same datasets and evaluate its performance in terms of accuracy, EER (Equal Error Rate), and computational efficiency. Compare the results with the original RawNet2 model to assess the impact of the new architecture.",
