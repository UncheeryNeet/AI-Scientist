        "Experiment": "Modify the RawNet2 architecture to replace the GRU layer with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Design the TCN to capture long-range temporal dependencies in the audio signals, ensuring it aligns with the computational constraints of the task. Integrate the TCN into the existing architecture in a modular way, allowing for easy comparison with the baseline model. Evaluate the modified model on the anti-spoofing task using metrics such as EER, t-DCF, FLOPs, and inference time to assess the impact of the TCN on performance and computational efficiency. Compare the results with the baseline RawNet2 model to determine the effectiveness of the TCN in capturing temporal patterns in audio signals.",
